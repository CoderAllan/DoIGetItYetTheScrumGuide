# DoIGetItYetTheScrumGuide
Training tool for the PSM I certification.

I made this tool when i was studying for the The Professional Scrum Master level I (PSM I).
The PSM I is an examination in this document: http://www.scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v1/scrum-guide-us.pdf

The tool is a supplement for the Scrum Open Asessment available here: 
https://www.scrum.org/Assessments/Open-Assessments/Scrum-Open-Assessment

The tool is a multiple choice test. Read the question, click the correct choice. If you clicked the wrong answer, then 
the paragraph with the correct answer from the Scrum Guide is shown.
