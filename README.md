# DoIGetItYetTheScrumGuide
Training tool for the PSM I certification.

I made this tool when i was studying for the The Professional Scrum Master level I (PSM I).
The PSM I is an examination in this document: http://www.scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v1/scrum-guide-us.pdf

The tool is a supplement for the Scrum Open Asessment available here:
https://www.scrum.org/Assessments/Open-Assessments/Scrum-Open-Assessment

The tool is a multiple choice test. Read the question, click the correct choice. If you clicked the wrong answer, then
the paragraph with the correct answer from the Scrum Guide is shown.

The application is a Windows Forms application. It is implemented using the pattern
Model-View-Presenter: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter
so it should be easy to change to another presentation framework or platform.
